## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install cpcbfetch:
```bash
pip install cpcbfetch
```

2. Install Jupyter:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

3. Install additional dependencies for notebooks:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn geopandas
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Navigate to the notebooks directory:
```bash
cd notebooks
```

2. Start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open any notebook and follow the instructions!

## üìä Data Requirements

- **Notebooks 1-3:** Work out of the box with real-time CPCB data
- **Notebook 4 (PM2.5):** Requires netCDF files for PM2.5 data
  - Download from: https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/
  - Place files in the `examples/` directory or update paths in the notebook

## üéØ Use Cases

These notebooks cover:

- ‚úÖ **Data Exploration:** Discover available monitoring stations and locations
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Monitoring:** Track air quality changes as they happen
- ‚úÖ **Historical Analysis:** Understand pollution trends over time
- ‚úÖ **Geographic Analysis:** Analyze air quality across different regions
- ‚úÖ **Visualization:** Create informative plots and maps
- ‚úÖ **Alert Systems:** Set up notifications for unhealthy air quality

## üí° Tips

1. **Start with Notebook 1** if you're new to cpcbfetch
2. **Uncomment code blocks** marked with `# Uncomment to run` when you're ready to execute them
3. **Customize locations** by changing coordinates to your area of interest
4. **Save your work** frequently - some analyses may take time
5. **Check data availability** - historical data may not be complete for all locations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import errors:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade cpcbfetch pandas matplotlib geopandas
```

**Network timeouts:**
- Check your internet connection
- Some CPCB endpoints may be temporarily unavailable
- Try again after a few minutes

**Missing data:**
- Not all cities have complete historical data
- Some monitoring stations may be offline
- PM2.5 netCDF files must be downloaded separately
